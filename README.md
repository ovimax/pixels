# Pixels

Pixels is a project that has to do basically with a pixel. The main goal of the project is to allow users creating their own pixel images and to print them on posters, t-shirts, mugs or other printable merchandising. The project will be divided in four stages, each one adding new features and updates. Despite having its own change log, each stage will be a version of the main project. Therefore stage number one will be version number one, and so on.

# Stages
